# CS361
Final Project
DETAILS:
	Uploaded Vicki's Racer, Stan's Channel, Sensor, and Button setup, and Josh's ChronoTimer and Race setup, as these were the ones announced that would be done, as per decision.
	Files were split for organization, can be changed at any point, but can't have files in default "src" if structure kept.
	
TODO:
	Channel, Sensor, and Button need to have JavaDocs as originally planned, as there are none.
	Channel needs to comply to Racer's methods.
	"Logging" class needs to be built to store info of choice for printing.
	"Interpreter" class needs to be built to send correct (not error checked) parameters to ChronoTimer class
	TOG vs TOGGLE has to be sorted out, same functionality as linked from manual to test data.
	Various TODOs around files with minor functionality notices.
