# CS361
Final Project
DETAILS:
	Uploaded Vicki's Racer, Stan's Channel, Sensor, and Button setup, and Josh's ChronoTimer and Race setup, as these were the ones announced that would be done, as per decision.
	Files were split for organization, can be changed at any point, but can't have files in default "src" if structure kept.
	
TODO:
	Channel, Sensor, Button and Racer need to have JavaDocs as originally planned, as there is none.
	Channel needs to comply to Racer's methods.
	ChronoTimer still needs a usable getTime() method, 
	Log needs to add functionality described in manual, not always print without print being invoked.
	TOG vs TOGGLE has to be sorted out, probably same functionality.
	Race trigger() and update() methods need to be handled.
	RaceIND needs to be filled out.
	Racer needs ChronoTimer passed in or ChronoTimer has to somehow be made global in order for getTime() to be acquired.
	Various TODOs around files with minor functionality notices.
